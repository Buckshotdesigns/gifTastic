# GifTastic
GifTastic is a simple but fun Gif generator based on movies. Click the button to load GIFs or type the name of one and add your own.

### Functionality
This application starts with some basic buttons that when clicked will generate gifs that are G or PG rated. There is also a field in which to type your own movie in and create a new button to click to add your own movie gifs. I have narrowed the parameters to try and search for movies only. Once the Gifs load to the screen you can click on them to start the animation and click again to stop it.
