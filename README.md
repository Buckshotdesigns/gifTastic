This is a very basic application that starts with some basic buttons that when clicked will generate gifs that are G or PG rated. There is also a field in which to type your own movie in and create a new button to click to add your own movie gifs. I have narrowed the parameters to try and search for movies only.

All in all its a real basic web application thats a fun way to use giphy to generate gifs.
